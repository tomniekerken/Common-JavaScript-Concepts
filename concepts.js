// ## 2 ## Defining variables
// 'var' was the common way to define variables but is now obsolete
// 'let' is the common standard for determining a variable 
// 'const' can be also used to determine a variable, but it's value cannot change after defining
// a variable declared with the 'const' keyword must be assigned a value at the time of declaration.
var varVariable
let letVariable
const constVariable = "value"

// ## 3 ## Primitive data types
